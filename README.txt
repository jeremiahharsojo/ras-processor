This project is for converting a .ras file (which I'm not sure what it is) to a more workable .csv format


processor.ipynb is a visual alternative (it roughy explains the process)
processor.py otherwise


Dependencies: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

INSTRUCTIONS
Change file_name to be the name of the file to be converted, then run the script. 
Script will output 2 csvs and the corresponding plotted data, one raw and one processed.
Feel free to modify the processing portion to fit needs.
